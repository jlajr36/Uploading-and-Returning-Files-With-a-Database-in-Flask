Uploading and Returning Files With a Database in Flask
Uploading files in Flask to a database is very simple. This code repo will demo the use of a HTML upload form to upload files to Flask and save them to blob columns in a database using SQLAlchemy. This code example uses SQLite for simplicity, but most popular database systems have support for BLOB columns (binary objects).

Prerequisites
-Python 3
-Python Flask
-Flask SQLALchemy

How to run the script
